### Hi there üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I'm Israel Castro Urieta, a passionate Frontend Software Engineer with expertise in React.js, Next.js, JavaScript, GraphQL, Tailwind CSS, and SASS. Over the past few years, I've transitioned from accounting to software development, driven by my enthusiasm for technology and web development.

My journey began with a blog I started about 12 years ago, where I shared articles on accounting, taxes, and financial topics. This project, built on WordPress, sparked my interest in web development.

In recent years, I've deepened my skills and knowledge in web development through continuous learning and practical experience. I completed comprehensive courses on Platzi, focusing on frontend technologies. Since then, I've been dedicated to honing my craft and expanding my expertise every day.

During my tenure at [Sof√≠a](https://www.linkedin.com/company/somossofia/) as a Jr. Software Engineer, I worked on impactful projects, including developing an electronic medical record, creating a B2B administration portal, developing an advanced portal for internal staff and enhancing a mobile app with React Native. These experiences have solidified my ability to build innovative solutions that improve user experiences and operational efficiencies.

Now, I'm always on the lookout for new challenges and opportunities to apply my skills. Whether it's through freelance projects or full-time roles, I'm excited to contribute to the tech community and create meaningful digital experiences.

Feel free to explore my repositories and get in touch if you'd like to collaborate!
