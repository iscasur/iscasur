### Hi there 🙋‍♂️
I studied accounting for about 8 years ago 📊. By then, I started a blog with WP for sharing articles for people interested in accounting, taxes, and financial stuff just like a hobby 🤓.

That was my first contact with the development of websites.

Last year I realized that this hobby was more than that 🤯 so I started to study web development in Platzi. Since then I haven't stopped studying every day for becoming a Front-End Developer 🎨.

This quarantine 🦠 just pushed me on to turn my career in tech, so basically, that was my opportunity to forward this objective.
